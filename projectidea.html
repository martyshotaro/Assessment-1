<h2>Project Idea</h2>

<h3>Overview - A summary of what the project will be./h3>

<p>The project that I’ve chosen is called "bounce the ball". This will be made from a site called MIT app inventor. The key features of this game include flicking the ball to a particular area, but there are obstacles that include a 2D fence/gate and they more horizontally throughout the duration of the game in order to get the ball through to succeed and win the game. It’s recommended for Android users since this MIT is associated with MIT.</p>  
  
<h3>Motivation - A description of why the project will be interesting or useful.</h3>  
  
<p>This would be a useful and an interesting app/game for individuals due to the fun aspect of it even if it were just a simple app/game; it takes way your stress, especially if you had a long day from work, studies and etc. This app is a perfect way to relax. Lastly, another interesting part of this is the low level of complexity and difficulty of this app/game, which indicates that it can be played by anyone of any ages.</p>
