<h2>Project Idea</h2>

<h3>Overview - A summary of what the project will be.</h3>

<p>The project that I’ve chosen is called "bounce the ball". This will be made from a site called MIT app inventor. The key features of this game include flicking the ball to a particular area, but there are obstacles that include a 2D fence/gate and they more horizontally throughout the duration of the game in order to get the ball through to succeed and win the game. It’s recommended for Android users since this MIT is associated with MIT.</p>  
  
<h3>Motivation - A description of why the project will be interesting or useful.</h3>  
  
<p>This would be a useful and an interesting game for individuals due to the fun aspect of it even if it were just a simple game; it takes way your stress, especially if you had a long day from work, studies and etc. This app is a perfect way to relax. Lastly, another interesting part of this is the low level of complexity and difficulty of this app/game, which indicates that it can be played by anyone of any ages. Statistics show that 6.8 million people around over 190 countries have used this app inventor to create more than 24 million apps, which indicates as a good sign.</p>

<h3>Description - A detailed description of the features of the product or service.</h3>
  
<p>The description of the features of MIT App Inventor includes the ability to drop/grab components to a design view and the use of visual blocks language in order to program application behavior. It provides a web based editing for the building of apps through iOS and Android (most recommended) in terms of their operating systems. Also, it has applied a block-based programming language built by Google Blockly. It also consists of such inspirations from languages that include StarLogo TNG and Scratch, which gives users the ability to build a smartphone app for their needs to be met. The purpose of its usage is it provides the families and communities the mobile solutions to real life situations/problems. Also, it’s adaptable way to serve requirements in terms of specific populations that include making aps for emergency and first responders and robotics. Other features of this app inventor include a user interface that consists of two main editors that include design editor and blocks editor. Design editor is a drop and drag interface that blueprints the elements of the individual’s user interface (UI), whereas the blocks editor is an environment that involves where the app inventors can visibly lay out the logic of their apps through the use of color-coded blocks that would join together, just like puzzle pieces in order to demonstrate the program. Lastly, in order to assist the development and testing, MIT provides a mobile app called the App Inventor Companion, in which the developers can use to adjust and test in order to monitor the behaviour of their apps. Hence, anyone can build a mobile app and immediately start to test and recapitulate quickly.</p> 

<h3>Tools and Technologies - The software, hardware and/or other equipment needed. Include any relevant open source tools as appropriate.</h3>
  
<p>The software that are a part of this game includes inspirations from languages such as Scratch and StarLogo TNG, which gives users the ability to build a smartphone app for their needs to be met. Also, other software components include GNU/Linux (Debian 5 or higher and Ubuntu 8 or higher), Windows (Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP), and Macintosh with an Intel Processor (Mac OS X 10.5 or more higher), which are all computer operating systems.</p>  
    
<h3>Skills Required - The skills are required for your project, including software that needs to be written, and special hardware (if any). How feasible will it be to find the skills, software and hardware required?</h3>
  
<p>The skills that are required for this project includes the basics of making your projects from MIT project app that include “Screen properties” in the settings area. For this project/app, you can either make the app scrollable or non-scrollable that will determine the screen’s final size that will or won’t allow users to scroll up and down. Also, the “drawing and animation section” is applied for the ball and canvas section of this project, and it’s also one of the skills required for the progress of this project. The “properties” pane section for the adjustment of either the height or the width of the opening of the canvas and for the ball, it adjusts the radius from 5 (which is the starting number), to 10 or 15 or the number of your choice as long as it’s bigger than 5. The “block” component for this project is also used for the movement of the ball when it flings through the use of clicking “Ball1” then pulling out “Ball1.Flung”, which makes it interesting. Also, a skill needed for this project is that when it wants to move towards the direction of the flung whilst matching the strength intensity equally of the fling gesture, the use of centre blocks for the ball’s heading and for the ball speed [TO BE CONTINUED].</p>
  
<h3>Outcome - If the project is successful, what will be the outcome? How will the original problem be solved? What impact will this development have?</h3>

<p>If this project was successful, the outcome will be a good starting point due to the usefulness of this app that will lead to enticing new users playing this game. With a combination of low levels of difficulty in terms of how to play the game and the skills needed and the simplicity of the game in terms of visuals, effects, and movements will lead this game to further success.</p>
