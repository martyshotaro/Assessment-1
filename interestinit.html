<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</h3>

<p>My interest in IT is specifically in networking because of its interconnected business contacts. This will lead to increased understanding, as networking is an excellent opportunity to exchange practice knowledge by learning techniques in the business of my fellow workmates in the future. Lastly, being on networking means more varied access to new and valuable information, the ability to backup data easily, as all data is stored, which is located on the file server.</p> 
<p>My interest in IT started around after the completion of my Certificate III in Individual Support and Ageing. It was a course that came straight to my mind. That was the time when realization hits me personally, as it should’ve been the thing that I could’ve done instead because I realized that IT is a career that’s beneficial for myself in the long run.</p>
<p>Lastly, there were particular people that motivated me to pursue IT, which were my church friends. Majority of them specialized in networking and the interesting aspect of it was creating rooms with passwords and meeting numbers in WebEx during virtual church services since it’s still lockdown here. They are also in charge of communicating with other IT church people if there are any troubles/uncertainties on how to get people in the virtual chat room, how to kick users out if there are uninvited people who got in our virtual church service and etc. This occurs when the virtual church service commences from the very start to the end.</p>
<p>Currently, I have no experiences on IT at the moment.</p>

<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>

<p>I came to RMIT because they offered me a spot for this unit at Open Universities Australia (OUA), as a pathway for my bachelor’s degree.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

<p>I expect to learn the skills that I haven’t learned and the skills that I’ve witnessed from some of my friends who are also IT graduates/students from different universities that include operating systems in both MacOS and Windows, the use of tools for collaboration and communication in Skype and WebEx and the use of office suites.</p>
