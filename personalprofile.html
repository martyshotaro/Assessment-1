It also shows the percentage of each traits mentioned, which will help me in terms of how I would act, behave, and take part within a workplace. Based on the results, I found out that my personality type is somewhat unique, as this could bring diversity and another arsenal in terms of different personality types in a workplace. I wasn’t also expecting that my personality type consists of excellent analytical abilities; though reserved, they have well-developed people skills and strong social relationships. Also, Defenders like myself are truly benefactors, where kindness meets together that engages other workmates to believe the process inside the workplace, with generosity and enthusiasm. However, despite being a generally a conservative type, Defenders are often receptive to change. As with so many things, other individuals with the Defender personality type like myself are more than the sum of their parts, and it’s a strategy they apply as strengths that defines who they are.</p>

Lastly, any negativity from conflict or criticism can carry over from their personal and professional lives. Also, the repression their feelings; defenders are more sensitive and private, which incorporates their feelings at a great deal. They must protect their own feelings and the inability to convey healthy emotional expressions can result in a lot of stress and frustration, even amongst your team members. Also, being reluctance to change can influence/affect behaviour in a tem within a workplace due to their history and traditions of value in their decisions in a highly manner. These challenges can be especially hard to address, as a situation sometimes needs to reach the breaking point before being convinced by circumstance.<p>

<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>

<p>These traits can possibly taken into consideration when it comes to forming a team by when taking things too personally, don’t jump to conclusions too quickly when you are being confronted, don’t make such assumptions about criticism or judgement all being directed to you. Maybe it’s not all about you, but about the ones judging and confronting you from their own viewpoint. Even though defenders are sensitive and private, they should practice daily mindfulness.
