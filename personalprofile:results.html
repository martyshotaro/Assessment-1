Lastly, they may act fast on ideas, and always straight to the point. Learning methods that suit pragmatists are practicals, problem setting, discussions and case studies.</p>  
<p>Lastly, for theorists, they would rather think problems logically, value objectivity and rationality and they like to assimilate unalike theories into reasonable theories. Also, they are disciplined and they aim to fit things into a rational order. They are also into principles, theories and basic assumptions.
